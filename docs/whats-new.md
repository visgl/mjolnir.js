# What's New

## v3.0

- ES module
- Improved TypeScript definitions
- Ready to use with script tag
- Hammer.js is no longer a dependency due to the lack of maintenance. It has been ported to TypeScript and incorporated into mjolnir.js' code base. This will allow us to better address bugs and security issues moving forward.
